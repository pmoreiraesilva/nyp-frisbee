**Title:** 

Learning in the Making

**Synopsis:**

Today's students need to be prepared for future careers and workplaces in which their factual knowledge may not be as important as the way they can apply that knowledge. This is one of the reasons why maker education, in which students get hands-on, collaborative learning experiences and solve authentic problems, is gaining popularity in many schools. Providing a framework for maker activities helps ensure that their use is intentional and meaningful. In this keynote session, participants will get to participate in an experiential learning cycle comprising of front-loading or framing activities, experiencing hands-on with maker activities and reflecting on the maker experiences.

| **Biography** |
|:---|
| Dr. Jackie Gerstein's byline is, "I don't do teaching for a living. I live teaching as my doing . . . and technology has amplified my passion for doing so." Currently she teaches graduate-level courses for Walden and Western's Governor’s Universities, and gifted education at an elementary public school. Her background includes a strong focus on experiential and adventure learning. She believes that one of the roles and responsibilities of the 21st century education is to share resources, ideas, and instructional strategies with other educators which she did through her recently published book – Learning in the Making. |
